\section{Lepton dressing}

\begin{frame}{Lepton dressing}
Electrons (and to a lesser extent) muons radiate photons as they traverse the detector. These photons are reconstructed as separate particles, while actually belonging to their mother electron. Clustering the photons in the vicinity of a lepton candidate helps recovering this energy which would otherwhise be lost. This improves the overall quality of the lepton reconstruction.

\vspace{1em}
The IsolatedLeptonFinder has been extended with an option to produce dressed leptons.
It can be set to either replace the regular lepton container or be produced in addition, for comparison and tuning.

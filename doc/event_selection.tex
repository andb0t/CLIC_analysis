\begin{frame}{Event selection}
A preliminary list of event selection cuts has been applied to select the \qqln\ final state:
\begin{itemize}
%
\item Pre-cut - an intermediate step to see separate effects
\begin{itemize}
\item Exactly one charged lepton
\item Exactly one muon (electrons are still undressed and left out for now)
\end{itemize}
%
\item Final - the preliminary full event selection
\begin{itemize}
\item The pre-cut selection
\item Remove events with forward jets by requiring $|\cos \theta| < 0.95$
\item Maximum total jet energy $< 750$~\GeV
\item Lepton $\pt > 30$~\GeV
\end{itemize}
%
\end{itemize}

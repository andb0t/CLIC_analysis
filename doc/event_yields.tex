\subsection{Single selection cuts}

\begin{frame}{Signal $WW\rightarrow\qqln$}
\input{\texpath/final_cut_signal_qqln.tex}
The relative efficiency of every selection cut is listed (`Single') as well as the total efficiency (`Total').
%
The number of entries and the scaled number of events, using the \xsec\ and luminosity, are shown as well.
\end{frame}

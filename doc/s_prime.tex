\section{S' reconstruction}


\begin{frame}{S' reconstruction}{Overall Strategy}
The general outline of the reconstruction is the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reconstruct $\nu$ \pz\ from kinematic system consisting of
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the two jets
  \item the lepton
  \item the known \Wboson\ mass
  \item the neutrino \px\ and \py\ taken to be the \met\ x and y components
  \end{itemize}
\item decide for one of the two solutions (case (a) on next slide)
\item decide what to do in case of negative determinant (case (b) on next slide)
\item Reconstruct the leptonic and hadronic \Wboson\ four-vector
\item Sum them up to obtain the WW system boost
\item Subtract this from the nominal beam energy
\end{itemize}
